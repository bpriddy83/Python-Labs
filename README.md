# Python-Labs
Collection of Labs in Python from Intro to Computer Science

This is a collection from intro to computer science, it has helped me to thorouly understand python comands and functionality.

Lab1:
  Gets user inputs as floats and does calculations

Lab2:
A - abbr
  Uses if, elif and else to translate a few text/twitter abbreviations into english
B - siblings
  Uses conditions and math operations to see if a user input is odd, between 10 and 100 inclusively,
  or if it is a 2 digit number whos digit's sum is 8
C - money
  Taking a user input for the type of currency wanted to be donated, ie EUR, and the conversion rate, the program calculates the value
  of the currency in dollars and prints the result to 2 decimal places
  
Lab3:
A - Tally
  Asks for user input of integers to add until the user enters 'quit' and then prints the results. While loop.
B - sum_digits
  The user inputs a number and the program adds the digits together, tells how many digits there were and their sum.
C - Collatz
  While the number is not 1, if it's an even number divide by 2, if it's an odd number multiply by 3 and add 1 until it reaches 1 and
  print all intermediates.
